Hangman is a classic word-guessing game where one player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.
The word is represented by a series of dashes, each dash corresponding to a letter in the word.
The game continues until the word is guessed correctly or the number of attempts run out, indicating that the guesser has lost.
